# React 18 Project with Node.js 16 for LangChain RAG Pattern with FastAPI

## Overview
This React 18 project utilizes Node.js 16 to connect to a FastAPI backend for implementing the LangChain RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pattern for Question and Answer (Q&A) tasks. 

## Features
- Utilizes React 18 for building a modern and interactive user interface.
- Integrates Node.js 16 for server-side logic and connecting to the FastAPI backend.
- Implements the LangChain RAG pattern for advanced Q&A tasks, enabling intelligent question answering.
- Utilizes FastAPI for building a high-performance backend API.

## Requirements
- Node.js 16 installed in your development environment.
- Access to a FastAPI backend for LangChain RAG pattern implementation.
- Basic knowledge of React, Node.js, FastAPI, and LangChain concepts.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up and configure the FastAPI backend for LangChain RAG pattern implementation.
3. Create **.env** file and populate:
- REACT_APP_API_HOST=http://127.0.0.1:8000
4. Perform a clean install of package dependancies:
```
npm ci
```
4. Start the Node.js server and run the React 18 application to interact with the LangChain RAG Q&A functionality.
```
npm start
```
